Before installing Kivent, you will need to add some python paths.

To do this you will fristly need to run file manager as root
(sudo nautilus)

Then you will need to show hidden files: 
view options, show hiddern files or ctrl +H) 

And you will need to look for a file named: .bashhrc in the home directory

When the file appears in text editor, add the following 3 paths (I added the paths on lines 4-6 
but you can add them anywhere!)

export PYTHONPATH="/home/andrew/kivy":$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="/home/andrew/cymunk":$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="/home/andrew/cymunk/cymunk/python":$PYTHONPATH

WARNING: Make sure that you restart the terminal after editing the file! 
Otherwise the changes will not take effect!!
